# SVM Optimization Engine: Classical ML Mastery

###  Overview
As a **Data Scientist and AI Engineer** with a B.S. in Data Science, this project demonstrates my foundational expertise in classical machine learning. While modern AI often leans on Transformers, the ability to implement and optimize **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** is critical for high-dimensional data where explainability and margin maximization are paramount.

### Technical Depth & Analytical Thinking
This implementation moves beyond "out-of-the-box" usage, focusing on the mathematical and structural nuances of SVMs:

* **Kernel Engineering:** Evaluated and implemented both **Linear** and **Non-linear (RBF)** kernels to handle varying data distributions and non-linear separability.
* **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Conducted rigorous tuning of the regularization parameter (**C**) to balance the trade-off between margin width and misclassification, and the kernel coefficient (**gamma**) for RBF sensitivity.
* **Statistical Validation:** Utilized advanced metrics including precision-recall curves and confusion matrices to validate model robustness across diverse test sets.
* **Visualization:** Developed custom scripts to render decision boundaries and support vectors, providing transparency into how the model segments complex feature spaces.

###  Business Value
* **Precision Modeling:** Ideal for scenarios where data is scarce or high-dimensional, providing a more resource-efficient alternative to deep learning.
* **Explainable AI:** Unlike "black-box" models, this SVM implementation provides clear insights into which data points (support vectors) are driving the classification logic.
* **Strategic Versatility:** This project complements my work at **Rutgers University** and the **InSyte Project**, showcasing a balanced toolkit that spans from classical statistics to generative AI.

### Technical Stack
* **Core Library:** Scikit-learn (SVC)
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Python 3.x
